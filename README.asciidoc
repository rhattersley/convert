Builds on the XSL stylesheet in
https://github.com/oreillymedia/docbook2asciidoc to provide automated
conversion of the CF convention document from
https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-convention.github.io/tree/master/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/docbooksrc[DocBook]
to AsciiDoctor-flavour AsciiDoc.

== Aims

. Demonstrate the feasability of maintaining the CF conventions as AsciiDoc.
. Determine the gap between (1) and full-featured AsciiDoc sources.
. Provide a processing chain which generates full-featured AsciiDoc sources
  from the DocBook sources.

== Strategy

. Maintain the DocBook sources as the *single* authoratitive source for
  the CF conventions document until agreement can reached with CF
  community to switch to AsciiDoc.
. Provide a three step processing chain:
.. Strip DOCTYPE declarations from sub-documents to enable processing
   with Saxon.
.. Process CF-specific content (e.g. remove revision highlights).
.. Perform generic DocBook->AsciiDoc conversion.

== Requirements

* The DocBook sources for the CF convention document.
* Python and the lxml package.
* A recent version of the Saxon XSLT processor, and a suitable Java
  runtime.
* asciidoctor
* ... and maybe asciidoctor-pdf (or another asciidoctor->PDF solution)
